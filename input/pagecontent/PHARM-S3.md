This section corresponds to transaction [PHARM-S3] of the IHE Technical Framework - Shipment notice. Transaction [PHARM-S3] is used by the Supply Supplier and the Supply Receiver actors. The Shipment notice [PHARM-S3] transaction is used to inform that items have been sent.

### X:Y.Z.1 Scope

With the Shipment notice [PHARM-S3] transaction, the Supplier informs the Receiver (the receiver of information, not necessarily the receiver of the supply) about the shipment of items, including updates.
The shipment (and respective notice) can be related to a Supply Request, or can be unrelated - some shipments are sent even without an supply order (for example consignment items which are supplied upon consumption, or in the case of vendor-managed inventory. See the IHE Supply Whitepaper for more details on the use cases).
